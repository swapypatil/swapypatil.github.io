Swapnajit Patil may, in the future, modify Github Trivia Quiz to run on infrastructure which Swapnajit Patil has full access to, which would allow Swapnajit Patil access to additional information about your interaction with the app. Should that occur, Swapnajit Patil will comply with its obligations under applicable privacy law, including updating this Privacy Policy as required.
